Description: The IOIndex is a collection of homophily measures for social networks. It quantifies and 
    expresses the tendency of members in a social network to connect to other members outside or 
    inside a certain group. These groups maybe defined by social categories like gender, 
    ethnicity, language, etc. In contrast to similar homophily indices the IOIndex does not compare 
    the in and out group orientation of a specific person to the number of possible in and out 
    group connections but it compares it to the average in and out group orientation of the other 
    network members. The IOIndex thus can be understood as a measure of activiy for a specific network 
    member. Next to the newly devoloped index we also inclued implementations of several older indces 
    as e.g. the well-known IE index and Yule's Q. These additional indices  can be used for validating 
    and double checking the results of the IOIndex procedures.
